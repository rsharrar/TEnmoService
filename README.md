# TenmoService

This is a Venmo-like service written in Java's Spring framework. We created a RESTful API server and a command-line interface for the client to use to interact with the server.

The application requires users to authenticate with a login and password. Once authenticated, the user is allowed to send funds to other users and make transaction requests to receive funds from other users.

Transaction history and pending transactions are persistent, and can be viewed by a user at any time.
